Workshop tools for d.camp Tokyo 2020

### Mood Checker
The campers can adjust the sliders any time during the day to show how they are feeling using the slider.

### Remote High Five
The campers can turn on the camera through this web app to show their location of their hand.
The location of other campers' hands are superimposed on the camera view, and if they are
aligned it creates a high five sound.
